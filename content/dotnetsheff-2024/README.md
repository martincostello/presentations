# dotnetsheff - March 2024

Slides for my presentation at [dotnetsheff][dotnetsheff],
_"[.NET patching with GitHub Actions][session]"_.

## Abstract

> With the productivity and performance benefits developers gain from using modern
> .NET over .NET Framework, also comes the less-exciting flip-side - patching the
> version of .NET in production environments every month to keep your applications
> secure.
>
> Keeping up-to-date with security and reliability fixes is an important ongoing
> activity within software development, but it’s not very exciting, and it can be
> easy to fall behind - what if we could automate the process of patching our applications?
>
> In this talk, we’ll explore how we can use the flexibility of GitHub Actions
> together with tools such as dotnet-outdated to automatically patch .NET applications
> on a monthly basis with minimal manual effort.
