# DDD South West 2023

Slides for my presentation at [DDD South West][dddsw2023], _"[Automating Monthly .NET Patching with GitHub Actions and dotnet-outdated][session]"_.

## Abstract

> With the productivity and performance benefits developers gain from using modern .NET over .NET Framework,
> also comes the less-exciting flip-side - patching the version of .NET in production environments every
> month to keep your applications secure.
>
> Keeping up-to-date with security and reliability fixes is an important ongoing activity within software
> development, but it’s not very exciting, and it can be easy to fall behind - what if we could automate
> the process of patching our applications?
>
> In this talk, we’ll explore how we can use the flexibility of GitHub Actions together with tools such as
> dotnet-outdated to automatically patch .NET applications on a monthly basis with minimal manual effort.
