Slides for my presentation at [.NET Conf 2024][dotnetconf], _"[Extending ASP.NET Core OpenAPI - Enrich your OpenAPI documents with examples, descriptions and more!][session]"_.

A recording of the talk can be [found on YouTube ðŸ“º][recording].

## Abstract

> In this session we'll take a look into the transformation interfaces that ship
> as part of the Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi NuGet package in ASP.NET Core 9 to
> see how we can build on top of them to enrich an OpenAPI document.
>
> Using document, operation and schema transformers, we'll take a look at an
> approach to add rich examples and descriptions to an API to help make it even
> easier for other developers to create an integration that depends on our
> application's API.
